# 🤖 Acceptable Use Policy: Generative AI & Automation

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines the standards for the ethical and secure use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Creator Business. As stated in our Manifesto, AI agents are treated as digital extensions of our workforce and must adhere to the same security and ethical rigor as human employees.

## 2. The Three Non-Negotiable Pillars

### 🔒 A. Data Privacy & Protection
* **No PII/Sensitive Data:** Users must not input non-public business data, financial records, or private legal documents into "Public" AI models (e.g., basic versions of ChatGPT or Midjourney).
* **Training Opt-Out:** Whenever possible, "Training" must be disabled in settings to ensure our Intellectual Property (IP) is not used to train global models.
* **Identity Management:** AI tools must be accessed via individual accounts with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. Shared accounts are prohibited.

### ⚖️ B. Transparency & Ethics
* **Content Disclosure:** Any AI-generated content (thumbnails, scripts, or b-roll) that is significantly altered by AI must be logged internally for transparency.
* **Bias Awareness:** Users must review AI outputs for harmful biases or hallucinations that could damage the brand's reputation.

### 👤 C. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation
* **The "Final Look" Rule:** No AI-generated content or automated workflow is permitted to publish directly to public platforms (YouTube, X, Instagram) without a human review and "Green Light" approval.
* **Security Verification:** Any code or scripts generated by AI must be manually reviewed for security vulnerabilities before being implemented in the business infrastructure.
